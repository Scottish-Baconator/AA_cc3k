This project includes a couple bonuses. In order to use them, simply run the game like this:
./cc3k -e [file name]
where [file name] is the optional file you want to load from
These extras are entirely based around a new item: armour, which reduces the damage taken from an attack
It also introduces a new player charachter who has default armour and higher stats, meant for an easier experience
