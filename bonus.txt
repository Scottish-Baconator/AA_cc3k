This project includes a couple bonuses. In order to use them, simply run the game like this:
./cc3k -e [file name]
where [file name] is the optional file you want to load from
These extras are almost entirely based around a new item: armour, which reduces the damage taken from an attack
Armour is shown as an A on the map and only spawns in the loot room, a room that doesnt spawn the player or have stairs in it. It provides 5 dmg resistance, to a minimum of 1 damage
Swords also spawn in the loot room, and provide a slight buff to attack.
Armour and swords are dropped on going to the next chamber
It also introduces a new player charachter who has default armour and higher stats, meant for an easier experience
Finally, by (u)sing a merchant, you can trade gold for items like potions, swords and armour
